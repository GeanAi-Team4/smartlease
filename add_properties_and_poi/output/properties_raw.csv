The fully stocked kitchen is equipped with everything you need to cook a basic meal, ensuring convenience and comfort. Just steps from the Boston Common, this neighborhood has had many personalities over the decades. Since the early 1900s, the area along Washington and Tremont Streets, roughly from School Street to Beach Street, has also been referred to as the Ladder District. Now it is most commonly named Downtown Crossing, as most of the city's subway lines intersect at Park Street station. The MBTA's Downtown Crossing subway station directly serves Downtown Crossing, and the State Street and Park Street stations are within close walking distance. Silver Line service is also available, allowing you to get anywhere in the city for a few dollars and a T-pass. The unit is accessible by self-check-in via a smart lock system, providing convenience and flexibility for your arrival.",APARTMENT,Beacon St Unit 1076780P,Beacon St,Unit 1076780P,Boston,MA,02108,2,1,,807,,1,8550,,,2025-04-25,,,,,,,False,,11,,,,Suffolk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/a318c2295983e976b38cc4ac8cad09e0l-m2633413157od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75,"https://ap.rdcpix.com/a318c2295983e976b38cc4ac8cad09e0l-m2633413157od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https://ap.rdcpix.com/a318c2295983e976b38cc4ac8cad09e0l-m798107161od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https://ap.rdcpix.com/a318c2295983e976b38cc4ac8cad09e0l-m1025789730od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https://ap.rdcpix.com/a318c2295983e976b38cc4ac8cad09e0l-m1254263382od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https://ap.rdcpix.com/a318c2295983e976b38cc4ac8cad09e0l-m1415730585od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https://ap.rdcpix.com/a318c2295983e976b38cc4ac8cad09e0l-m536180806od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https://ap.rdcpix.com/a318c2295983e976b38cc4ac8cad09e0l-m337816405od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https://ap.rdcpix.com/a318c2295983e976b38cc4ac8cad09e0l-m2558695813od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https://ap.rdcpix.com/a318c2295983e976b38cc4ac8cad09e0l-m249686138od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https://ap.rdcpix.com/a318c2295983e976b38cc4ac8cad09e0l-m967170417od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https://ap.rdcpix.com/a318c2295983e976b38cc4ac8cad09e0l-m3255185063od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https://ap.rdcpix.com/a318c2295983e976b38cc4ac8cad09e0l-m1728727281od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https://ap.rdcpix.com/a318c2295983e976b38cc4ac8cad09e0l-m3608562276od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","Beacon St Unit 1076780P, Boston, MA 02108"
